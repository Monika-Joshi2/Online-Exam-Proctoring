# Online Exam Proctoring System

This project is an AI-powered solution designed for real-time monitoring during online exams. It uses face detection, optical flow, and motion analysis to ensure exam integrity.

## **Features**
- **Face Detection**: Identifies if no face, a single face, or multiple faces are in the frame.
- **Speech Detection**: Tracks mouth movement using optical flow to detect speaking activity.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Displays status like "No Face Detected," "Multiple Faces Detected," or "Talking Detected."

## **Technology Used**
- **Optical Flow**: Tracks motion between frames to detect activity.
- **OpenCV**: Handles face detection and motion tracking.
- **Python**: Core programming language.
